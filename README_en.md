# Alist Install Script
[中文版](https://github.com/Zhang12334/Alist_install_bash/blob/main/README.md)

This project is an Alist installation script adapted for multiple architectures and various Linux kernel versions.

All files are from the official Alist release version (GitHub Release).

It comes with multiple built-in GitHub acceleration mirror sources and supports custom mirror sources.

Supports installation on Android Termux without root permissions.

After installation, a 20-character strong password is automatically generated using urandom and set as the Alist admin password.

Supports multiple architectures, various Linux kernel versions, and multiple systems (even runs on Android!).
